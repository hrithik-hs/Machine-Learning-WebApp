# Machine-Learning-WebApp
A Machine Learning WebApp using Streamlit and Python

## Description
The WebApp aims at training a machine learning model to predict weather the mushroom is poisnous or not using the mushrooms dataset. The WebApp provides an interface to choose between the different classifiers (i.e. SVM, Logistic Regression & Random Forest) and change their respective hyperparametes. When classified the WebApp can plot the results in Confusion Matrix , ROC Curve or Presision-Recall Curve.

## Prerequisites
